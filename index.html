              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
              capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React components:<em
                >bundles of reusable, nestable code.</em
              >
              You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
              let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

              React Native runs on <u>React,</u> a popular open source library
              for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of
              React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
              can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>
            <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <p>
              <strong> + components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to
              React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures
              that need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong> + JSX.</strong>
              React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
              elements inside JavaScript like so:
              <mark>&lt Text&gt Hello, I am your cat!&lt/Text&gt.</mark>
            </p>
            <p>
              The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can
              refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
              variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
              <mark>name</mark> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly
              braces inside<mark>&ltText&gt&lt/Text&gt</mark>
            </p>
            <p><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as
              arguments you use to configure how components render, state is
              like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for
              handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
              interaction. State gives your components memory!

        <section>
          <div class="text-list">
            <h2>handling text input</h2>
            <span class="pseudo-title">Chapter 4</span>

            <p>
              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an <em>onChangeText</em> prop that takes a function to be
              called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
              that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
